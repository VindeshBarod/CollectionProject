Java List

Some of the important points about Java List are;

Java List interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
List allows you to add duplicate elements.
List allows you to have ‘null’ elements.
List interface got many default methods in Java 8, for example replaceAll, sort and spliterator.
List indexes start from 0, just like arrays.
List supports Generics and we should use it whenever possible. Using Generics with List will avoid ClassCastException at runtime.
